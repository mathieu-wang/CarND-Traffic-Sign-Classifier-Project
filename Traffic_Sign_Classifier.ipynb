If additional code is required that cannot be included in the notebook, be sure that the Python code is successfully imported and included in your submission, if necessary. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate where you should begin your implementation for your project. Note that some sections of implementation are optional, and will be marked with **'Optional'** in the header.\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.\n",
