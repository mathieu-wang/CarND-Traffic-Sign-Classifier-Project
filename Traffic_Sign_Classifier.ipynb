If additional code is required that cannot be included in the notebook, be sure that the Python code is successfully imported and included in your submission, if necessary. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate where you should begin your implementation for your project. Note that some sections of implementation are optional, and will be marked with **'Optional'** in the header.\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.\n",

    "A big part of implementing a solution is to build the pipeline from loading, preprocessing, training, validating to testing.\n",
    "Therefore, I first started off with a simple linear model, which allowed me to find easy bugs such as size mismatch errors. Then, using a deep network with only fully connected layers helped me find more bugs in accuracy evaluation functions which gave me unusually low accuracies. Finally, using the LeNet archtecture and tweaking the parameters and sizes was the key step to get high accuracies for the solution. Since LeNet has been validated on the very similar MNIST dataset, it is a great starting point for a more complex architecture to solve the traffic sign classification problem."
